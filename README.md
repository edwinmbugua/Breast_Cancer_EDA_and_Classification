Diagnosis denote (M = malignant, B = benign) The features computed for each cell nucleus include:

1) radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)
2) texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)
3) perimeter
4) area
5) smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)
6) compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0)
7) concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)
8) concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)
9) symmetry
10)fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" - 1)

Later I shall use Logist regression SVM,Decision Trees algorithms to predict classification of the breast cancer diagnosis.
